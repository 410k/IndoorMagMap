Indoor Magnitude 

This project aims at building an Indoor localization Application using Ambient Magnetic Field available in Indoor  Environments. We implement a particle filtering algorithm for this purpose. The magnetic field in the Indoor Environments is sampled and provided aprior to the system. The location of the pedestrian is to be estimated. This project uses the source code available at https://github.com/divyekapoor/wifilocator and builds upon this.
